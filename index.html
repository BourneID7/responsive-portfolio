                <p>Professionally, I am a full-time senior graphic designer and photographer with an extensive background in visual design including print advertising, brochures and catalogs, packaging, web design, photo editing and manipulation, logo design, and illustration. I use the Adobe Creative Suite of applications including Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Acrobat, as well as several CMS-based web platforms. I am currently enrolled in the UW Extension Coding Bootcamp, learning full stack web development. I am looking forward to a new career as a web developer, and I believe my visual design background will be a benefit to future employers. After all, who doesn't want a website that works well and looks great too?</p>
                <p>On the personal side, I enjoy hot rods and classic cars. I drive a 1927 Ford T-bucket. In summer I frequently combine my love of cars and photography by taking artistic detail photos of the cars at local car shows. I have also recently discovered a passion for gardening and inventing new recipes that make use of the fruit in my garden.</p>
